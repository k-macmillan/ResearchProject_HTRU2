# Classification of HTRU2 Data Set
This is an exploration into using TensorFlow to classify a data set.

## Data Set
The data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2 "UCI Machine Learning Repository"). 
It includes 17,898 records with 1,639 real pulsar examples and 16,259 negative examples caused by interference/noise.
There are eight continuous variables and a binary class variable.

## Goals
- [x] Determine data set
- [x] Build TensorFlow from source
- [x] Classify data set
- [x] Explore alternative classification techniques
- [ ] Write paper about methods tested

## Paper
The paper will be written to [NIPS standards](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/PaperInformation/StyleFiles), utilizing [nips_2017.sty](https://media.nips.cc/Conferences/NIPS2017/Styles/nips_2017.sty).
